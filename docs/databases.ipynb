    "Vector search is a cutting-edge approach to searching and retrieving data that leverages the power of vector similarity calculations. Unlike traditional keyword-based search, which matches documents based on the occurrence of specific terms, vector search focuses on the semantic meaning and similarity of data points. By representing data as vectors in a high-dimensional space, vector search enables more accurate and intuitive search results."

    "Vector embeddings is a powerful technique for transforming complex data into numerical forms that can be easily processed and analyzed by machine learning algorithms. It basically allows us to take virtually any data type and represent it as vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it isn't as simple as just turning data into vectors. We want to ensure that we can perform tasks on this transformed data without losing the data's original meaning. For example, if we want to compare two sentences, we don't want just to compare the words they contain but rather whether or not they mean the same thing. \n",
    "\n",
    "To preserve the data's meaning, we need to understand how to produce vectors where relationships between the vectors make sense. To do this, we need what's known as an embedding model. We apply a pre-trained machine learning model that will produce a representation of this data that is more compact while preserving what's meaningful about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of embeddings is to capture the semantic meaning or relationships between data points in a way that similar items are close together in the vector space, and dissimilar items are far apart. For example, consider two words \"king\" and \"queen\". An embedding might map these words to vectors such that the difference between the \"king\" and \"queen\" vectors is similar to the difference between the \"man\" and \"woman\" vectors. This reflects the underlying semantic relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of embeddings:\n",
    "- Dimensionality: The number of elements in the vector. Higher dimensions can capture more complex relationships but are computationally more expensive.\n",
